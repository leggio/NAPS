# Not a Pyramid Scheme (NAPS)

Our project is TOTALLY not a pyramid scheme...

Users can mint NFTs that themselves can mint up to two children NFTs. When these children NFTs sell, royalties are earned by the NFT's parent, their parent's parent and so on.

The top address is a DAO, where ownership of the NFTs represents a user's voting power. User's can mint Level 1 NFTs from the DAO directly, but the price to do so increases after every minting.

This use case is a meme, but the more abstract technology we've developed could have legitimate use-cases in the world of IP royalties management. It isn't hard to imagine a world where software is sold, and the authors of the dependencies of that software earn revenue.
